This project was built using Javascript. It makes use of six different sounds which you can use to create some beats.
Simply click on any of the six pads at the bottom of the screen and each of them will produce their own unique sound.
Keep clicking till you find a nice rythm. Enjoy!

This project was inspired and taught by [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q) on YouTube.
