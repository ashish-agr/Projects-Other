This project was built using Javascript and CSS. It is a very simple preloader for a website. The CSS file has a few lines which actuallly unable us to fade into our main website after it has loaded.
But in order to demonstrate the preloader, those lines have been commented out. After a few additions to the HTML and CSS we can use it to direct ourselves to the actual content.
Thus, the Javascript in this project is not being implemented in this state of the project.

This project was inspired and taught by [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q) on YouTube.
