This project was built using Javascript. It is a completely browser responsive app. 
This app also uses flexbox and stores to-do items in the browser's local storage, hence retaining all items on refresh.
The local storage however doesn't retain the 'completed' state of the todo item as the implementation of it would have been too complicated.

This project was inspired and taught by [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q) on YouTube.
